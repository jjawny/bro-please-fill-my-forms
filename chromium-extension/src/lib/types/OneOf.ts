/**
 * Simple Descriminated Union Type (by checking isOk)
 * Messages for UI (toasts, helper text, etc) also acts as a slim stack trace
 *
 * FINDINGS/REALISATIONS when designing around ONE OFS functions:
 *  - Every function that's "Just My Code" should return a OneOf
 *     except for atomic functions that we don't expect to fail (helpers/utils)
 *     what's left are basically functions for biz logic/orchestration/using 3rd party libs more
 *  - âˆ´ our code outside of <Components/> are just a bunch of OneOf functions (a.k.a OneOfs)
 *
 *  - OneOfs should reduce decision-fatigue (always return the same type)
 *  - OneOfs should speed-up debugging; the type forces us to package errors as values and a quick way to check later (Go-lang inspired)
 *  - OneOfs should always merge messages from other OneOfs after calling (maintaining order)
 *  - OneOfs should not console.log/debug, because we already bundle messages across the entire stack trace of messages, the caller can decide to log/toast
 *  - OneOfs should not console.error expected errors (like failed decryption using nodeJS crypto lib) because...
 *  - OneOfs should always console.error UNEXPECTED errors when caught (as these are errors we need to fix)
 *  - OneOfs should never return nullish values, instead, fallback to <string, string> for the final success/error toast messages (like ErrOr status code)
 *
 *  - What are the entry points?
 *     99% of code execution/the stack trace will start from an event handlers/useEffect hooks/service workers (ignoring network-driven types; web sockets/SSE/polling)
 *
 *  - Why not new up a dedicated OneOf object?
 *     using the pure type (creating object literals) has better perf (less memory) just GPT "Performance of creating object literals from my OneOf type vs using a dedicated OneOf class"
 *     apparently 2-10x faster creation (CPU perf) and 20-30% less heap usage (MEM perf)
 *
 *  - Realised OneOfs are like heavy functions and for this app, all <Components/> call OneOfs via Zustand stores (which call more OneOfs down the stack trace)
 *  - Realised this starts to build a simple flow/map/visual of a React app like my ASP.NET Web API architecture
